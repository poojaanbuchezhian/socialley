  bio: "Robert W. Wilson shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics, becoming the first American astronomer to be so honored. The prize was awarded to Wilson and to Arno Penzias for their discovery in 1965 of a universal background radiation, a remnant of the 18-billion-year-old &quot;big bang&quot;. Wilson, head of Bell Telephone Laboratories¿ radio physics research department, was for many years involved in the development of ultra-low-noise receivers for long distance satellite communication. He was instrumental in initiating millimeter-wave astronomical observations of radiation from molecules. A native of Houston, Texas, Wilson graduated from Rice University in 1957 with honors in physics. Caltech awarded him a PhD in 1962 for research in radio astronomy and after a postdoctoral year at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory he went to Bell Labs. Wilson, a member of the American Astronomical Society, received the 1977 Herschel Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society."
